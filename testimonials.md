  Becky has the gift of transforming a house into a cozy, welcoming home! She has worked with me through five moves and it just doesn’t feel like home until Becky’s touches are in place. Her sense of design, color and placement are amazing, but the best part is the inviting feeling she creates in every room. Becky always works within my budget using a mix of new and existing furnishings, custom curtains and upholstery, and unique accessories she adds for her signature blend of style. –Siobhan Kelly

  I would only ask Becky to help me with interior designing because her ideas are fresh, new, exciting, innovative and comforting. She adapted to our décor and also added her ideas to make our home a place of which to be proud. I highly recommend her. She will add a new and better dimension to your living. –Ann Gusweiler Hall

  I highly recommend Becky Interior Design. The work Becky did for me was classic and timeless, which is just what I wanted. She really listens to and observes what the client wants, and this makes the end result so personal. I also like the fact that no job is too small. When I first hired Becky, I was planning on having her do one room; my family room. I loved the result so much, we ended up doing the whole house. Her warm and comfortable nature makes working with her a pleasure and I look forward to doing future projects together. – Patty Ross

  Becky has helped me with my decorating needs on two homes. She helped me to redecorate several rooms in one home and then when we bought our current home she was there to help me navigate the major renovations that we went thru. She helped me turn each of those houses into beautifully decorated homes that matched our lifestyles and personal tastes. No job was ever too small or too large for her to handle. –Teri Fletcher

  Becky is not your “typical” interior designer.  Here’s what sets her apart:  she is truly a professional who takes the time to get to know her client’s tastes and lifestyle.  She understands the importance of integrating existing decor and staying within a budget.  Her sense of color and texture whether it be on the wall, carpet or sofa is impeccable.  Becky has guided me through a two story home addition, three bathroom remodels and countless rounds of room “facelifts”.  With humor and warmth, she has created an inviting, beautiful and functional space for me and my family.  It is my pleasure to highly recommend Becky Barras Interior Design. -Maureen Vignola
